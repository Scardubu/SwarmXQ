# workflow-automation

Design durable execution with retries, idempotency, checkpoints, and rollback boundaries.

- Triggers: workflow automation, durable execution, checkpoint, rollback
- Stack: generic
- Owner: system
- Weight: 5

## Use it for
- Long-running or failure-prone agent flows.
- Making automation rerunnable and auditable.
- Preventing partial runs from corrupting state.

## Execution pattern
- Prefer the smallest useful action.
- Compare 2-3 internal variants only when the task is non-trivial.
- Run one skeptical check for edge cases, missing evidence, and simpler alternatives.
- Keep the result concise, deterministic, and directly usable.

## Elite operating discipline
- Prefer the smallest useful action that still satisfies the objective.
- For non-trivial tasks, compare 2-3 internal variants, run one skeptical check, and keep the winner silently.
- Keep assumptions explicit, outputs directly usable, and failure signals short and concrete.
- Stop early when the requested boundary is satisfied; do not smuggle in unrelated improvements.

## Elite change-control notes
- Freeze the acceptance criteria or baseline before modifying behavior.
- Keep structural changes separate from behavioral changes.
- Verify the smallest safe slice, then expand only after the current slice is proven.
- Surface regressions, drift, and rollback risk immediately when they appear.
