# template-authoring

Maintain reusable prompt, workflow, and review templates.

- Triggers: architecture, workflow, skill, template, evidence, safety
- Stack: generic
- Owner: system
- Weight: 5

## Execution pattern
- Prefer the smallest useful action.
- Compare 2-3 internal variants only when the task is non-trivial.
- Run one skeptical check for edge cases, missing evidence, and simpler alternatives.
- Keep the result concise, deterministic, and directly usable.

## Elite operating discipline
- Prefer the smallest useful action that still satisfies the objective.
- For non-trivial tasks, compare 2-3 internal variants, run one skeptical check, and keep the winner silently.
- Keep assumptions explicit, outputs directly usable, and failure signals short and concrete.
- Stop early when the requested boundary is satisfied; do not smuggle in unrelated improvements.

## Elite skill-shaping notes
- Encode reusable behavior as a compact triggerable primitive with a clear output contract.
- Prefer structure that supports routing, validation, and downstream composition.
- Remove redundancy, but preserve the smallest amount of context needed for reliable execution.
- Validate that the skill remains distinct from neighboring skills and does not duplicate responsibility.
